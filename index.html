<h1>Top 50 Operating System Interview Questions</h1>

<div class="grid">

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">1</div>
  <div class="question">What is an Operating System?</div>
  <div class="answer">
An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources. It acts as an interface between the user and the hardware. The OS is responsible for managing processes, memory, files, and input/output devices. Examples include Windows, Linux, and macOS.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">2</div>
  <div class="question">What are the main functions of an OS?</div>
  <div class="answer">
The main functions of an operating system include process management, memory management, file management, and I/O device management. It also provides security, a user interface, efficient resource utilization, and error detection and recovery.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">3</div>
  <div class="question">What is a Process?</div>
  <div class="answer">
A process is a program in execution. It includes the program code, data, and its current execution state. Each process has its own resources and is scheduled for execution by the operating system.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">4</div>
  <div class="question">What is a Thread?</div>
  <div class="answer">
A thread is a lightweight unit of a process. Multiple threads can exist within a single process and share its resources. Threads help improve performance and responsiveness.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">5</div>
  <div class="question">What is the difference between a Process and a Thread?</div>
  <div class="answer">
A process has its own separate memory space and is expensive to create. A thread shares memory with other threads in the same process and is lightweight. Thread switching is faster than process switching.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">6</div>
  <div class="question">What is Multitasking?</div>
  <div class="answer">
Multitasking allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by rapidly switching the CPU between tasks. It improves system efficiency and is commonly used in modern operating systems.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">7</div>
  <div class="question">What is Multiprocessing?</div>
  <div class="answer">
Multiprocessing uses multiple CPUs or processor cores to execute tasks in parallel. It increases system performance and is commonly used in servers and high-end systems.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">8</div>
  <div class="question">What is Multithreading?</div>
  <div class="answer">
Multithreading allows multiple threads within a single process to run concurrently. It improves CPU utilization and is widely used in applications such as web browsers.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- SAME FORMAT CONTINUES FOR ALL QUESTIONS -->

<div class="card">
  <div class="q">50</div>
  <div class="question">Why is an Operating System important?</div>
  <div class="answer">
An operating system is important because it manages system resources efficiently, provides a user interface, ensures security and stability, and enables applications to run smoothly. Without an OS, a computer system cannot function effectively.
